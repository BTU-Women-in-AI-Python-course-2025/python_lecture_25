# Types of Hosting Providers

When deploying a Django app, the type of hosting you choose affects performance, cost, and control over your infrastructure. Here are common hosting types:

1. **Shared Hosting**:
   - **Description**: Multiple websites share a single server.
   - **Best For**: Small, low-traffic sites.
   - **Pros**: Cheap, no management needed.
   - **Cons**: Limited resources, slow during high traffic.

2. **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**:
   - **Description**: A physical server is divided into several virtual servers.
   - **Best For**: Moderate-traffic apps needing more control.
   - **Pros**: More control, scalable.
   - **Cons**: Requires server management, more expensive than shared hosting.

3. **Dedicated Hosting**:
   - **Description**: Entire server dedicated to one application.
   - **Best For**: Large, high-traffic applications.
   - **Pros**: Full control, powerful performance.
   - **Cons**: Expensive, requires technical knowledge.

4. **Cloud Hosting**:
   - **Description**: Uses multiple virtual servers across the cloud.
   - **Best For**: Apps with unpredictable or growing traffic.
   - **Pros**: Highly scalable, reliable.
   - **Cons**: Complex pricing, technical setup.

5. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**:
   - **Description**: Fully managed platforms that abstract server management.
   - **Best For**: Developers who want quick deployments without managing servers.
   - **Pros**: Simple to use, automated scaling.
   - **Cons**: Less control, can be expensive.

6. **Serverless Hosting**:
   - **Description**: Runs your app in functions, only when triggered.
   - **Best For**: Apps with low or variable traffic.
   - **Pros**: Cost-efficient, no server management.
   - **Cons**: Cold start delays, limited control over long-running processes.
